This file contains all the English translations needed. Due to the complexity, I'll need to carefully construct this in the actual JSON file.

I need to add:
- landing.* (header, hero, stats, features, workflow, benefits, faq, cta)  
- feedback.* (title, subtitle, labels, etc.)
- tax_guide.* (title, sections, lists, disclaimers)
- auth.* (login, register forms)
- deadline_popup.* (title, warning, messages)
